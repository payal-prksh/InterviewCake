You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
Write a function getProductsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

We can do this in O(n)O(n) time and O(n)O(n) space!

We only need to allocate one new array of size n.
